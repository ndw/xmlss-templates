# XML Summer School 2011 S5 Slide Template

This project contains a skeletal project that provides the XML Summer
School "look and feel" as a S5 theme.

See 's5slides.html' for sample.

Run 'style/s5slides.xsl' on 'src/slides.xml' to remake 's5slides.html'.

S5 itself is explicitly released into the Public Domain.  See
